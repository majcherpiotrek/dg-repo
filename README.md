# Project setup instruction

Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/piotrmajcher94/dg-repo.git`

## Frontend:
### How to start

Check if you have node installed, type `npm version` in the terminal/command line,  
if you don't have it install it [from here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm).

Install the Angular CLI with `npm install -g @angular/cli`  

Open the termina/command line in the "frontend" folder in the cloned repository and type `npm install`

Now just type `ng serve` and go to `localhost:4200` to verify if the app works.

### Creating new components

You can create new components with `ng generate component component-name --spec false` (the `--spec false` to skipe the .spec files)  

If you want to nest the new component within another existing one type:  
`ng generate component ./existing-component-name/new-nested-component-name --spec false`  
(the root for this command is the `app` folder)  

You can make the command shorter by just typing `ng g c new-component --spec false`


### Angular autogenerated information

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.1.

### Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

### Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.

### Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

### Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
Before running the tests make sure you are serving the app via `ng serve`.

## Backend:

1. Setup MongoDB on Windows (without docker) [instruction on the mongo website] (https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-windows/)
* download mongodb for windows from [here](https://www.mongodb.com/download-center#community)
(These instructions assume that you have installed MongoDB to C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\)
* open command line as an administrator and create two directories:<br />   
> mkdir c:\data\db      
> mkdir c:\data\log
* create Mongo configuration file - mongo.cfg : `C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\mongod.cfg`
* add following lines to the configuration file you just created:<br />      
> systemLog:        
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;destination: file
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;path: c:\data\log\mongod.log   
> storage:        
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dbPath: c:\data\db
* now run this command to install mongo db service : `"C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\bin\mongod.exe" --config "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\mongod.cfg" --install`

Now you can always start the MongoDB service now from the command line (running as administrator) by typing:    
`net start MongoDB`   
or stop it with   
`net stop MongoDB`   

The MongoDB should be available at `localhost:27017`. If any problems occur, check the mongo log at     
`C:\data\log\mongod.log`   

2. Start the spring boot project in IntelliJ:
* open the "backend" directory in IntelliJ (leave all configurations deafault - there should be using gradle wrapper checked as default etc.)
* refresh gradle project to download all dependencies: View -> Tool Windows -> Gradle, when the gradle window appears click the "Refresh all gradle projects" button (left upper corner of the gradle window).
* setup run configuration: Run -> Edit configurations -> cliclk "+", choose "Spring Boot", main class should be "com.dgteam.dgbackend.DgBackendApplication", "Use classpath of module:" -> "dg-backend-main". Then "Apply", "OK" and you should have this run configuration available.

When running the project make sure that the MongoDB service is up and running. The application handles `requests on localhost:8080`
