# Project setup instruction

## Frontend:

### How to start

Check if you have node installed, type `npm version` in the terminal/command line,  
if you don't have it install it [from here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm).

Install the Angular CLI with `npm install -g @angular/cli`  

Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/piotrmajcher94/dg-frontend.git`

Open the termina/command line in the folder of the cloned repository and type `npm install`

Now just type `ng serve` and go to `localhost:4200` to verify if the app works.

### Creating new components

You can create new components with `ng generate component component-name --spec false` (the `--spec false` to skipe the .spec files)  

If you want to nest the new component within another existing one type:  
`ng generate component ./existing-component-name/new-nested-component-name --spec false`  
(the root for this command is the `app` folder)  

You can make the command shorter by just typing `ng g c new-component --spec false`
